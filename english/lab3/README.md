# Lab 3: Prompt Engineering

## Overview

In this laboratory, you will explore the main prompt engineering techniques to optimize interaction with language models and achieve more accurate and relevant results. Prompt engineering is a fundamental skill for maximizing the performance of generative AI models.

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of prompt engineering
- Master different prompting techniques
- Apply advanced strategies to improve response quality
- Implement best practices in prompt design

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of AI and language models
- Completion of Lab 1 and Lab 2 (recommended)
- Access to Azure AI Foundry

## Laboratory Content

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
Learn to create effective prompts without providing examples, using only clear and specific instructions to guide the model.

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting
Explore how providing a few examples in the prompt can significantly improve the quality and consistency of model responses.

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Discover how to encourage the model to show its step-by-step reasoning, resulting in more logical and well-founded responses.

### 4. Meta Prompting
Understand how to create prompts that instruct the model on how to approach different types of tasks more efficiently.

### 5. Prompt Chaining
Learn to divide complex tasks into a sequence of simpler and more focused prompts.

### 6. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
Explore an advanced technique that allows the model to consider multiple lines of reasoning simultaneously.

### 7. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Understand how to combine external information with prompts to generate more accurate and up-to-date responses.

### 8. Active-Prompt
Discover techniques for creating prompts that adapt dynamically based on context and feedback.

### 9. Best Practices

Apply fundamental principles to create more effective prompts:

- **Be Specific**: Leave as little as possible to interpretation. Restrict the operational space.
- **Be Descriptive**: Use analogies to make instructions clearer.
- **Reinforce Instructions**: Sometimes it may be necessary to repeat yourself to the model. Provide instructions before and after your main content.
- **Order Matters**: The order in which you present information to the model can impact the result. Recency bias can affect how the model processes information.
- **Offer an Alternative**: Give the model an alternative path if it cannot complete the assigned task. For example: "respond with 'not found' if the answer is not present."

## Instructions

1. Open the `lab3.ipynb` notebook in Azure AI Foundry
2. Execute cells sequentially, observing examples of each technique
3. Experiment with modifying prompts to see how changes affect results
4. Compare the effectiveness of different approaches for similar tasks

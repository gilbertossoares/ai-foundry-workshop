# Lab 4: AI Frameworks - Semantic Kernel and AutoGen

## Overview

In this laboratory, you will explore advanced frameworks for building intelligent applications: **Semantic Kernel** and **AutoGen** with Azure OpenAI. You'll learn how to create conversational agents, orchestrate multiple agents, implement custom plugins, and develop complex automation workflows.

**Semantic Kernel** is Microsoft's open-source SDK that enables integrating AI models (like Azure OpenAI) with conventional programming languages, offering features like plugins, planning, and memory management.

**AutoGen** is Microsoft's framework for creating multi-agent applications where different agents can collaborate to solve complex problems through structured conversation.

## Objectives

- ✅ Master Semantic Kernel for AI orchestration and plugin development
- ✅ Understand AutoGen for multi-agent conversational systems
- ✅ Create custom plugins and specialized agents
- ✅ Implement complex workflows with both frameworks
- ✅ Compare when to use each framework for different scenarios
- ✅ Build a practical product analysis system combining both technologies

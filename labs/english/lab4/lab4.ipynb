    "   - `AssistantAgent`: Specialized in creativity and idea generation\n",
    "   - Uses `model_client` instead of the old `llm_config`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`run()` Method**: The new API uses the `run()` method which:\n",
    "   - Accepts a task as string\n",
    "   - Returns a `TaskResult` with messages\n",
    "   - Is asynchronous by default\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Specialization**: The agent has a `system_message` that defines its role and specific behavior.\n",

    "### Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory, we explored the powerful capabilities of **Semantic Kernel** and **AutoGen** (version 0.6+) to create advanced intelligent applications with Azure OpenAI. We learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Kernel\n",
    "- ✅ Kernel configuration and initialization\n",
    "- ✅ Creation and use of custom functions\n",
    "- ✅ Working with built-in and custom plugins\n",
    "- ✅ Prompt templates and dynamic arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AutoGen\n",
    "- ✅ Agent configuration with the new API\n",
    "- ✅ Using `model_client` instead of `llm_config`\n",
    "- ✅ Asynchronous `run()` method for execution\n",
    "- ✅ Domain-specific agent specialization\n",

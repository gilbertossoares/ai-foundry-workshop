    "Azure AI Foundry allows you to use most of the following service features without needing to write code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Named Entity Recognition (NER)** - Named entity recognition identifies different entries in text and categorizes them into predefined types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal and health information detection** - PII detection identifies entities in text and conversations (chat or transcriptions) that are associated with individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language detection** - Language detection evaluates text and detects a wide range of languages and variant dialects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment analysis and opinion mining** - Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are pre-configured features that help you understand public perception of your brand or topic. These features analyze text to identify positive or negative sentiment and can link them to specific elements within the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summarization** - Summarization condenses information for text and conversations (chat and transcriptions). Text summarization generates a summary, supporting two approaches: Extractive summarization creates a summary by selecting key phrases from the document and preserving their original positions. In contrast, abstractive summarization generates a summary by producing new, concise, and coherent sentences or phrases that are not directly copied from the original document. Conversation summarization recaps and segments long meetings into chapters with timestamps. Call center summarization summarizes customer problems and their resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key phrase extraction** - Key phrase extraction is a pre-configured feature that evaluates and returns key concepts in unstructured text, returning them as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entity linking** - Entity linking is a pre-configured feature that disambiguates the identity of entities (words or phrases) found in unstructured text and returns links to Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text analytics for health** - Text analytics for health extracts and labels relevant health information from unstructured text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom text classification** - Custom text classification allows you to build custom AI models to classify unstructured text documents into custom classes you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Named Entity Recognition (Custom NER)** - Custom NER allows you to build custom AI models to extract custom entity categories (labels for words or phrases), using unstructured text you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conversational language understanding** - Conversational language understanding (CLU) allows users to build custom natural language understanding models to predict the overall intent of an incoming utterance and extract important information from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orchestration workflow** - Orchestration workflow is a custom feature that allows you to connect Conversational Language Understanding (CLU), question answering, and LUIS applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question answering** - Question answering is a custom feature that identifies the most appropriate answer for user inputs. This feature is typically used to develop conversational client applications, including social media platforms, chat bots, and voice-enabled desktop applications."

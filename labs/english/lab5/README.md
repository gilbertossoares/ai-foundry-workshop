# Lab 5: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Implementation with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search

In this laboratory, you will learn how to implement a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system using Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search. This architectural pattern is fundamental for improving language model responses with specific information from your own knowledge base.

## Objectives

- Understand the RAG concept and its applications
- Configure an Azure OpenAI service
- Configure an Azure AI Search service
- Create and load documents into a search index
- Implement a complete RAG flow in a Python notebook
- Test queries that combine model generation with relevant document retrieval

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription with access to Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search services
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Visual Studio Code or other development environment
- Basic knowledge of Python and REST APIs

## Reference Architecture

RAG is a pattern that combines information retrieval from a knowledge base with text generation by a language model. The basic architecture includes:

1. **Knowledge Base**: Documents indexed in Azure AI Search
2. **Retrieval Service**: Azure AI Search to find relevant documents
3. **Language Model**: Azure OpenAI to generate responses informed by retrieved documents

## Laboratory Guide

### 1. Azure Services Configuration

#### Azure OpenAI
- Provision an Azure OpenAI service
- Deploy the GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 Turbo model
- Obtain access credentials (endpoint and key)

#### Azure AI Search
- Create an Azure AI Search service
- Configure a search index
- Obtain access credentials (endpoint and key)

### 2. Data Preparation

- Prepare documents that will serve as the knowledge base
- Process and index documents in Azure AI Search
- Verify that indexing has completed successfully

### 3. RAG Implementation

Open the `rag_example.ipynb` notebook to follow a practical example of:

- Connection to Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search services
- Search query formulation
- Relevant document retrieval
- Construction of enriched prompts with retrieved context
- Response generation using Azure OpenAI
- Evaluation and refinement of results

### 4. Experimentation and Testing

- Experiment with different queries
- Adjust search and generation parameters
- Compare responses with and without the retrieval component

## Next Steps

After completing this laboratory, consider:
- Adding semantic filtering techniques
- Implementing result reranking
- Developing a web application that uses this RAG pattern
- Exploring advanced techniques like chunking and document embedding

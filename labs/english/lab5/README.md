# Lab 5: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation

## Overview

In this laboratory, you will implement a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI. RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation, enabling language models to access specific external knowledge beyond their training data.

You will explore:
1. **Query without RAG**: How LLMs respond without additional knowledge
2. **Azure AI Search configuration**: Preparing vector search indexes
3. **RAG implementation**: Integrating search with response generation
4. **Results comparison**: Demonstrating the difference between responses with and without RAG

## Objectives

- ✅ Understand fundamental RAG concepts and architecture
- ✅ Configure Azure AI Search for vector search capabilities
- ✅ Implement a complete RAG pipeline from documents to responses
- ✅ Compare quality between responses with and without RAG
- ✅ Apply best practices for production RAG systems
- ✅ Handle real-world scenarios like document chunking and embedding storage

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with access to Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Search
- Environment variables configured in the `.env` file at repository root
- Python 3.8 or higher

2. Semantic search for relevant documents
3. Context selection and formatting
4. Prompt construction with retrieved information
5. LLM generation with grounded context
6. Response post-processing and validation

### Exercise 7 - Results Comparison and Evaluation

**Quality Assessment:**
- Compare responses with and without RAG
- Evaluate accuracy and relevance improvements
- Assess factual grounding and hallucination reduction
- Measure response quality and completeness

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Factual accuracy and correctness
- Relevance to user queries
- Completeness of information
- Consistency with source documents
